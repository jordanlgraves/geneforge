## GenoCAD - WEB
A design tool rooted in formal language theory, GenoCAD lets you construct genetic circuits using context‐free grammars. It's especially strong for specifying and managing genetic parts in a user‐friendly, rule-based environment.

## COPASI
Widely used for simulating biochemical networks, COPASI offers detailed time-course simulations, steady-state analysis, and parameter estimation. It's a robust option if you want to dive deep into kinetic modeling.

## Tellurium
An integrated Python-based environment that leverages libRoadRunner, Tellurium supports the simulation of SBML models and offers both deterministic and stochastic solvers. Its scripting flexibility makes it attractive for automated workflows.

## BioNetGen
For cases where your circuits have combinatorial complexity, BioNetGen's rule-based modeling framework is ideal. It allows you to specify interactions at the domain level and simulate the resulting dynamics.

## Virtual Cell (VCell)
VCell provides a comprehensive platform for modeling cellular processes—including spatial, stochastic, and deterministic simulations. It's particularly useful if you're interested in incorporating more realistic cell geometries or spatial effects.

## BioUML
This integrated platform combines data analysis, modeling, and simulation with a strong focus on systems biology. BioUML can be a good alternative when you need advanced visualization and model sharing capabilities.

## ReaDDy
If spatial stochastic dynamics are critical, ReaDDy is a particle-based reaction–diffusion simulator that can capture these effects at the molecular level.

## Proto BioCompiler
For automated design, Proto BioCompiler can generate optimized genetic regulatory networks from high-level specifications—adding another layer to your design automation pipeline.

## SynBioHub (as a complement)
While not a simulation tool per se, SynBioHub serves as a repository and standards platform (using SBOL) that can integrate with many of the tools above, ensuring your designs are well annotated and interoperable.

## TinkerCell
A modular CAD tool with a graphical interface that lets you visually design genetic circuits and integrate simulation routines via C or Python APIs.

## Eugene
A rule-based design language that enables the generation of combinatorial libraries of genetic constructs, making it a good complement for automating design variations.

## SBOLDesigner
Focused on creating and editing designs that adhere to the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard, it streamlines communication and sharing of genetic constructs.

## chopchop
CHOPCHOP is a python script that allows quick and customizable design of guide RNA. We support selecting target sites for CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cpf1, TALEN and NICKASE with wide range of customization. We even support Cas13 for isoform targeting.

## Cas-OFFinder
An ultrafast and versatile algorithm that searches for potential off-target sites of CRISPR/Cas-derived RNA-guided endonucleases.

## OSTIR
OSTIR is a Python package for predicting the rates at which ribosomes will bind to and initiate translation from different start codons in bacterial mRNAs. It uses the ViennaRNA Package to perform the necessary free energy calculations. The code builds on the last open source version of the RBS calculator.

## ViennaRNA
A C code library and several stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures.

## JASPAR
JASPAR CORE database contains a curated, non-redundant set of profiles, derived from published collections of experimentally defined transcription factor binding sites for eukaryotes.

## GPro
A user-friendly integrated platform that encompassing state-of-the-art generative promoter design methodologies. GPro standardizes the promoter design process into a fixed pipeline, allowing for the creating of synthetic promoters suitable by utilizing the prescribed sets of promoter sequences and gene expression data. Additionally, GPro offers comprehensive computational analysis reports, facilitate the assessments of the generated promoters across different dimensions of quality and functionality. https://github.com/WangLabTHU/GPro
