# LLM-Driven Genetic Circuit Design System – Project Plan

## Introduction

Designing genetic circuits in *E. coli* can be accelerated by combining a Large Language Model (LLM) agent with specialized bioinformatics tools. The goal is an autonomous Python-based system that iteratively designs, evaluates, and optimizes genetic circuits in silico. The LLM agent will orchestrate multiple tools (running locally) to propose circuit designs, simulate their behavior, analyze performance, and refine the designs based on feedback. This plan outlines the toolchain, integration strategy, an example iterative workflow, the feedback loop mechanism, and considerations for scaling the approach to mammalian systems in the future. The emphasis is on a detailed, actionable design where each component and connection is clearly defined.

## Tool Selection and Integration Strategy

To cover all aspects of circuit design and testing, we will integrate several categories of tools. All tools will be accessible via Python (through APIs, command-line calls, or libraries) to ensure seamless agent control. Key tool categories and chosen examples include:

### Genetic Circuit Design – Cello

We will use Cello for automated circuit design from high-level logic specifications. Cello converts a Boolean logic description (Verilog) into a DNA sequence encoding a transcriptional circuit. It uses a library of characterized promoters/repressors as genetic logic gates (e.g., NOT/NOR gates) and assigns parts to implement the desired truth table. Cello's automated workflow insulates gates from context and produces complete plasmid designs. The integration plan is to run Cello via its command-line interface or REST API (since Cello allows external connections via API) from Python. The LLM agent will provide a Verilog logic specification and a User Constraint File (UCF) for *E. coli* parts, then parse Cello's output (DNA sequences and part list). This forms the initial circuit design for further refinement.

### Promoter & Repressor Design/Mutation Tools

To fine-tune gene expression, the agent will modify promoter sequences or repressor proteins and predict the effects:

- **Promoter strength prediction**: We can integrate PromoterPredict, a standalone tool that uses sequence models to predict *E. coli* σ⁷⁰ promoter strengths. PromoterPredict takes -10 and -35 hexamer sequences and returns predicted strength, and it can even learn from new data to improve predictions. The agent can use this to evaluate mutations in promoter sequences (e.g., changing a base in the -35 box) and select variants with desired strength (higher or lower as needed). Alternatively, modern ML models (as in the GPro toolkit) can be employed – GPro encapsulates various promoter strength predictors (CNNs, LSTMs, etc.) for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The plan is to use such a model via a Python API to score or even generate promoter variants.

- **Repressor/DNA-binding mutation**: To adjust a repressor's binding affinity or dynamics, the agent may simulate mutations in the repressor coding sequence or its operator site. In practice, we might have a small library of repressors with varying strengths (or mutants with known effects). If available, the agent could call a protein-DNA binding affinity predictor (e.g., a tool like FoldX or a simplified model) to estimate how a mutation changes repression. Initially, we will likely handle this by parameter tuning in the simulation (e.g., altering a repression constant to mimic a stronger or weaker repressor) rather than detailed protein modeling. The agent's strategy will be: if a repressor is too weak, try a different repressor protein (from a parts library) or propose a mutation in the binding interface and evaluate its effect via the model. Tools for in silico mutagenesis like Pyvolve (for DNA sequence evolution) could assist in generating variant sequences, which we then evaluate with the above predictive models.

### CRISPR Guide Design Tools

If the circuit uses CRISPR-based regulation (for example, a dCas9 repressor activated by a gRNA), the system needs to select guide RNA targets and include Cas9 expression in the design. We will integrate a gRNA design tool such as CHOPCHOP or Cas-OFFinder to find target sites with minimal off-targets. These tools allow input of a DNA sequence or gene and output high-scoring guide sequences. For example, CHOPCHOP can suggest gRNAs optimized to avoid off-target effects in the host genome. The agent will use such a tool by providing the target gene sequence (from the current circuit) and retrieving candidate gRNA sequences. Off-target analysis can be done by scanning the *E. coli* genome for near matches (some tools have command-line off-target scanning). Coordination of Cas9 expression means the agent must also insert a Cas9 (or dCas9) gene into the circuit under an appropriate promoter. We will treat Cas9 as another component to tune – e.g., using a moderate constitutive promoter to express Cas9 so that it's available for the gRNA to function. The agent can adjust the Cas9 promoter or RBS if needed to balance activity (high enough for function but not so high as to burden the cell). In summary, the CRISPR design integration involves: (a) using a Python-callable gRNA design algorithm to get guide sequences, (b) adding the gRNA and Cas9 into the circuit, and (c) using feedback (if, say, cleavage or repression is too strong/weak, adjust the gRNA target location or Cas9 level in subsequent iterations).

### mRNA Expression Prediction & Tuning

To ensure each gene in the circuit is expressed at the right level, we incorporate tools for mRNA-level optimization:

- **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) design**: We will use the RBS Calculator model (or its open-source equivalent) to predict and control translation initiation rates. The RBS Calculator can design synthetic RBS sequences to achieve a targeted translation rate for a given coding sequence. This allows the agent to fine-tune protein expression over a wide range (100,000-fold, as reported) by altering the RBS region. In practice, we may use an open Python package like OSTIR (Open-Source Translation Initiation Rate predictor) which implements the Salis lab model, to get a translation rate prediction for a candidate RBS sequence. The agent can run in "design mode" to generate an RBS that yields a desired output (e.g., if a protein needs to be expressed 10x more, design a stronger RBS). Integration is done by calling the RBS design function with the coding sequence and desired rate, then replacing the RBS in the DNA sequence.

- **Codon optimization and mRNA stability**: We will integrate codon optimization tools to adapt coding sequences for *E. coli* usage and minimize problematic motifs. For example, DNA Chisel is a Python library that can optimize a DNA sequence subject to various constraints (codon usage, GC content, no restriction sites, etc.). We will use DNA Chisel to ensure each gene's coding sequence is optimized for *E. coli* codon bias and does not form stable secondary structures that could reduce translation. The agent can specify constraints like "codon optimize this CDS for *E. coli*" and "avoid strong hairpins", and DNA Chisel will return an adjusted sequence. Additionally, the ViennaRNA package (through its Python bindings) will be used to predict mRNA secondary structures. The agent might fold the 5' UTR of each mRNA to check if the RBS is in a loop or double-strand; if so, it could introduce synonymous mutations (via DNA Chisel) to open up the structure. In summary, the mRNA tuning tools ensure that once promoters and repressors are decided, the actual gene sequences can be optimized for robust expression.

### Circuit Simulation and Validation Tools

After constructing a circuit design (with specific DNA sequences and assigned parts), the agent must simulate its behavior. We will use dynamic simulation to evaluate circuit performance:

- **ODE/Stochastic simulation**: The plan is to represent the circuit as a set of reactions or an SBML model and simulate it with Tellurium (which provides a Python environment around the libRoadRunner simulator). Tellurium allows us to define the network (e.g., as reactions or in Antimony model format) and then run deterministic or stochastic simulations easily. We will build a simulation model by leveraging part characterization data. For instance, Cello's part library provides transfer functions for gates (mapping input promoter activity to output expression) – these can be converted into Hill-function equations in an ODE model. The LLM agent can automate this conversion: after Cello picks specific repressors and promoters, the agent knows their parameters (Hill coefficients, etc. from the UCF) and can generate an SBML or Antimony model of the circuit's transcriptional regulation. Tellurium will simulate time-course responses for different input combinations. This allows the agent to verify if the logic behavior is correct (e.g., truth table is satisfied) and measure performance metrics (rise time, signal levels, leakiness, etc.). Integration is via the Tellurium Python API – the agent will programmatically assemble the model (using a library like libSBML or Tellurium's loada function with Antimony string) and call the solver to get results.

- **Logical/steady-state checks**: In addition to full ODE simulations, we can perform simpler logical validation. For example, after design, we expect certain outputs to be ON or OFF given input combinations. The agent can use the transfer functions directly to compute the steady-state output for each input case (similar to how Cello predicts circuit scores). This is a quick check of logic correctness before running detailed simulations. If a logic error is found (output not matching specification), the agent can promptly adjust the design or try a different assignment. This logical simulation might be done with a custom Python function or by reading Cello's own predictions (Cello outputs predicted output levels for each truth table row).

All these tools will be executed locally, ensuring the agent can run autonomously without internet. We will need to install the necessary packages or have them containerized. The integration points will be via Python: e.g., calling a command-line tool using subprocess (for Cello, possibly Cas-offinder), using Python libraries (for DNA Chisel, ViennaRNA, Tellurium, etc.), and possibly parsing output files (e.g., reading Cello's SBOL/GenBank output). We will also define a standard data model for the circuit within the agent (perhaps using SBOL or a simple Python class) so that the design can be passed between tools consistently (e.g., from Cello's output to simulation input).

## System Architecture and Workflow

The overall system follows an iterative design loop where the LLM-driven agent generates a design, tests it, and improves it. The architecture can be thought of in phases, each handled by specific tools as outlined above. Below is the step-by-step workflow that the agent will perform autonomously:

### Initial Specification & Design Generation

The process starts with a high-level specification of the desired circuit. This could be a truth table or logic description provided by the user (for example, "Implement a NOR gate with inputs A and B"). The LLM agent translates this specification into a Verilog program (if not already given) and uses Cello to synthesize an initial genetic circuit design.

**Example**: Given a target truth table, the agent writes a Verilog module with the corresponding logic. It calls Cello (via Python) with this Verilog and the *E. coli* parts library (UCF). Cello returns a DNA design – e.g., it might choose LacI and TetR repressors to build a NOR logic, and output DNA sequences for two plasmids containing the necessary promoters, RBSs, genes, and terminators. The agent parses this output, now having a concrete circuit (DNA sequence and part list).

### Simulation of Circuit Behavior

Next, the agent constructs a computational model of the designed circuit and simulates its behavior in silico. Using Tellurium (or an equivalent), it encodes the network of interactions: promoters driving gene expression, repressors binding operators, etc., with kinetic parameters from the part characterization. The agent runs simulations for key input scenarios (all combinations of inputs if digital logic, or a range if analog levels) to obtain the circuit's output (e.g., reporter protein levels over time).

**Example**: The agent creates an ODE model for the NOR gate circuit. It simulates two cases: inputs A=B=0 (should yield output ON) and A=1, B=1 (should yield output OFF), among others. The time-course results show that in the A=B=0 case, the output protein reaches a high steady-state concentration of, say, 20 µM, and in the A=B=1 case, it goes down to 5 µM but not zero, indicating a leak.

### Analysis of Performance vs. Targets

The agent evaluates whether the circuit meets design criteria. It checks logic correctness (did each input combination give the correct qualitative output?) and other metrics (dynamic response time, ON/OFF ratio, leaky expression in "OFF" state, etc.). This analysis is done by interpreting the simulation results. The LLM agent can be prompted with the numeric outcomes and the desired behavior to reason about what aspects are suboptimal.

**Example**: From the simulation, the agent observes that when the output is supposed to be OFF, it's at 5 µM instead of ~0. It identifies this as a leaky output issue. It also notes maybe the difference between ON (20 µM) and OFF (5 µM), while correct logically, might not be large (only 4-fold). Ideally, a larger ON/OFF ratio is desired for a robust circuit. The agent might also see that the time to switch OFF is long (e.g., if turning off the output takes several hours, it's sluggish).

### Diagnosis and Refinement Decision

Based on the performance analysis, the LLM decides how to improve the circuit. Each shortcoming can suggest a specific refinement:

- If output is too low in the ON state or the OFF state is too high (leaky), the agent considers adjusting promoter strengths or repressor binding. For low ON output, perhaps the promoter driving the output gene is too weak; for high OFF leak, perhaps the repressor isn't strong enough or its binding site on the output promoter could be improved.
- If the response is too slow, the agent might try increasing expression of a regulator (stronger RBS or promoter for the upstream transcription factor) so that it can accumulate faster.
- If a logic condition fails (say the output was ON when it should have been OFF), it could mean the part assignments aren't suitable (maybe cross-talk or saturating effects); the agent might in that case go back and try an alternative design (e.g., use a different repressor or logic gate from the library). The LLM uses tool outputs as feedback: e.g., it might prompt itself with something like, "The OFF-state output is 5 µM, which is nonzero. Hypothesis: the promoter is leaky. Solution: use a weaker promoter or add an extra repressor." Such reasoning will lead it to choose a refinement action and corresponding tool.

**Example**: In our NOR gate case, the agent decides the OFF leak is the primary issue. It hypothesizes that the output promoter is too strong basally. It chooses to mutate the output promoter to reduce basal expression. It calls the promoter design tool (PromoterPredict or similar) to generate a variant of that promoter with a lower predicted strength. Alternatively, it might add a second repressor binding site to that promoter if the design allows (though that's a bigger structural change). For this iteration, the agent opts to try a weaker promoter variant.

### Applying Refinements

The agent now uses the appropriate tool to implement the chosen refinement:

- For the promoter tweak: It might alter the -10 or -35 sequence of the promoter slightly. Using the promoter model, it finds a mutation that decreases predicted strength by e.g., 50%. It then edits the circuit design – replacing the promoter sequence in the DNA.
- It could also adjust the RBS strength via the RBS design tool if needed (e.g., to compensate, if it weakened the promoter and fears the ON output might drop too much, it could simultaneously strengthen the RBS of the output gene to balance).

These changes are applied to the circuit representation the agent maintains (updating the DNA sequence and noting any new part parameters).

**Example**: The agent mutates the promoter's -35 box from "TTGACA" to "TCGACA", which the model predicts to cut the promoter strength in half. It also decides to strengthen the RBS for the output gene to keep the ON level adequate – it uses the RBS Calculator in design mode, requesting a 2x higher translation rate, and gets a new RBS sequence which it inserts. The design is now version 2.

### Re-simulation and Iteration

With the modified design, the agent goes back to simulation (Step 2) to see how the changes affected performance. It runs the same tests again on the updated circuit. The results are then analyzed (Step 3) to see if the issues have been resolved or if new issues arose. The cycle repeats: simulate → analyze → refine, in an autonomous loop.

**Example**: After the promoter weakening, the simulation shows the OFF-state output is now 1 µM (improved from 5 µM, so leak is reduced). The ON state with the new RBS is about 15 µM (slightly lower than 20 µM, but still distinguishable from 1 µM, giving a 15-fold ON/OFF ratio, which is much better). Logic is correct and leak is mostly fixed. The agent notes the improvement. Perhaps it sees a slight new issue: the ON level dropped a bit; if that's acceptable, it may consider the design "good enough." If not, it could try a minor tweak to boost the ON state (maybe even stronger RBS). For now, it deems the performance acceptable as it meets the design criteria. The iteration stops.

### Design Output

The final optimized DNA sequence(s) and a summary of the design are produced. The agent can output the plasmid sequences, a schematic (if needed, generated from the design data), and documentation of performance. This final design is ready for experimental testing.

Throughout this workflow, the LLM agent orchestrates the tools by generating the necessary inputs (Verilog code, sequence modification instructions, etc.), calling the tools, and interpreting their outputs to decide next steps. Each iteration is driven by feedback from the previous round, enabling autonomous refinement until the circuit meets specifications.

## Feedback Loop and Autonomous Refinement

A robust feedback loop is central to the LLM-driven system. The loop connects tool outputs back into the agent's decision-making:

### Data Collection

After each tool execution (design, simulation, analysis), the agent gathers key results. For instance, after simulation, it might extract the steady-state output levels for each input condition and the time taken to reach steady state. After a promoter strength prediction, it gets a numeric score of promoter activity. These results are structured (as JSON or plain text with labels) so the LLM can interpret them.

### LLM Reasoning

The agent (an LLM) is prompted with the current design state and the new results. The prompt may include: a summary of the goal, a summary of the current design (e.g., "output promoter X, RBS Y, repressor Z"), the performance metrics ("ON output=15 µM, OFF output=1 µM, ON/OFF ratio=15, target ratio > 10, OK; response time=30 min, target < 1 hr, OK; leak still present but small"). The prompt then asks what improvements (if any) are needed. The LLM uses its reasoning capabilities to analyze this and decide on an action. Essentially, the tools provide a quantitative critique, and the LLM generates a design improvement solution in response.

### Decision Heuristics

We will also encode heuristic rules that map observed issues to potential fixes, to guide the LLM. For example:

- If OFF-state output > threshold, then consider stronger repression or weaker promoter.
- If ON-state output is below target, then strengthen promoter or RBS.
- If both ON and OFF are low (circuit doesn't output at all), then possibly the logic assignment failed – consider redesign (invoke Cello with different parameters or library).
- If response time is too slow, then increase expression of the limiting component (e.g., use higher copy number or faster transcription).

These can be provided to the LLM in the prompt or handled by a simple rule engine that the LLM can consult. The LLM thus doesn't operate blindly; it follows an analyze → propose fix cycle consistent with synthetic biology design principles.

### Iterative Improvement

The feedback loop continues until the analysis phase reports that all criteria are met (or no further improvement is gained). Importantly, the agent is autonomous in this loop – no human input is needed after the initial specification. The LLM-agent stops when, for example, "All test cases passed and performance metrics are within acceptable range." We will include a guard for a maximum number of iterations to avoid infinite loops (and perhaps have a fallback to suggest human inspection if it can't converge on a solution in, say, 5-10 iterations).

**Example of Feedback in Action**: In the earlier NOR gate example, the agent observed OFF-state leak and decided to weaken the promoter. That decision was a direct result of the feedback (OFF output = 5 µM was higher than the ~0 µM expected). The agent's reasoning might have looked like: "OFF output is nonzero, which indicates leaky expression. I should reduce the promoter's basal activity or increase repressor efficacy. I will try reducing promoter strength first." It then carried out that change and re-tested. This loop (detect issue → fix issue) is repeated for each aspect of performance. The agent effectively performs a form of automated design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle in silico, where build is the design step, test is the simulation, and learn is analyzing results to inform the next design change.

### Logging and Knowledge Retention

Each iteration's outcome will be logged. Over time, the LLM agent can accumulate knowledge on what fixes tend to work for certain problems. This could be used to refine the prompt or even fine-tune the LLM for better suggestions. For example, if multiple designs show that a particular promoter often causes leakiness, the agent might learn to avoid that promoter in future initial designs. While this is a future enhancement, it shows how feedback enables not just single-circuit optimization but improvement of the design strategy itself.

In summary, the feedback loop ensures that tool outputs directly guide the LLM's design modifications. The system behaves as an autonomous engineer, using quantitative feedback to iteratively hone the genetic circuit design until it meets the desired specifications.

## Future Scalability to Mammalian Systems

Scaling this LLM-driven design system from *E. coli* to mammalian cells will require addressing additional complexity in tools and design principles. Below are recommendations and considerations for adapting the system to mammalian genetic circuit design:

### Tool Adaptation and Selection for Mammalian Context

Many of the core functionalities remain the same (circuit assembly, promoter/RBS design, simulation), but we need mammalian-specific tools:

- **Genetic circuit design**: Cello's paradigm could, in theory, be extended to mammalian parts. However, as noted in the literature, adapting Cello to mammalian cells is challenging due to context-dependence. One approach is to develop a mammalian library of parts (promoters, transcriptional repressors/activators like dCas9-based gates or TetR orthologs that work in mammalian cells) and corresponding UCF files for Cello. Indeed, Cello has been used with yeast by employing ODE-based models for parts. For mammalian circuits, a similar approach could be taken: define a set of synthetic transcription factors or CRISPRi-based logic gates that function in human cells and characterize their transfer functions. The project should incorporate emerging design frameworks not strictly tied to digital logic. For instance, a 2021 study demonstrated model-driven mammalian circuit design without the direct electronics analogy – integrating such methods could allow automated design even when parts aren't perfectly insulated. **Recommendation**: Start by expanding the parts library with well-characterized mammalian regulatory elements (e.g., different constitutive promoters, inducible promoters, Zinc-finger or TALE repressors, CRISPRi elements) and use a modified version of Cello or a custom design algorithm to handle these. We may consider tools like Boolean logical modeling combined with heuristic search for mammalian circuits until something like "Cello for mammals" matures.

- **Promoter and enhancer design**: Mammalian gene expression is controlled by promoters and enhancers, which are more complex (having multiple transcription factor binding sites, chromatin context, etc.). We should integrate advanced AI models for promoter/enhancer activity prediction, such as deep learning models (e.g., DeepPROM, DeepSTARR for enhancer activity). The GPro toolkit already supports eukaryotic sequence models, which could be leveraged for human promoters. The agent might use a generative model to design synthetic promoters that achieve desired expression levels in a given cell type. Additionally, tools for insulator sequences (to buffer genetic context) should be considered – e.g., designing flanking insulator elements if cross-talk is an issue.

- **CRISPR and regulatory interactions**: In mammalian systems, CRISPR-based regulation (CRISPRi/a) is a popular way to implement logic. The agent should integrate gRNA design with the reference human (or mouse) genome for off-target scanning, since off-target effects are a bigger concern in large genomes. Tools like CRISPOR or CRISPRitz can handle genome-wide off-target search. Coordination of Cas9/dCas9 expression in mammalian cells involves choosing delivery strategies (plasmid vs viral) and promoters that work in those cells (possibly tissue-specific promoters if needed). The design might also involve multiple layers, e.g., one gRNA regulating another via cascade, which the agent needs to manage. We should include the ability to design RNA interference or microRNA-based logic too, as these are common in mammalian circuits (the agent could select miRNA target sites similarly to CRISPR guides, using known databases of miRNA-binding).

- **mRNA and codon optimization**: Codon optimization is crucial when expressing bacterial or synthetic genes in mammalian cells. The agent can use DNA Chisel with a human codon usage table, or IDT's codon optimization rules, to recode genes. mRNA structure prediction remains useful; additionally, tools to minimize immune epitopes (if producing a protein in cells) might be needed when moving to therapeutic contexts. The agent might incorporate a check using tools like BLAST against human genome to ensure no cryptic splicing or integration sites are present.

- **Simulation**: Mammalian gene circuit simulation often requires more complex models. Unlike fast bacterial circuits, mammalian circuits may have slower dynamics and additional layers (signal transduction, protein degradation tags, etc.). We might need to integrate cellular compartment models (nuclear vs cytosolic), since transcription happens in the nucleus and some regulatory mechanisms (like nuclear import of transcription factors) matter. Tools like BioNetGen or even whole-cell simulators could be considered for complex cases. However, for practicality, we can continue using SBML ODE models via Tellurium – just expanding them to include e.g., translation and degradation with mammalian rates. The agent should incorporate known parameter values for mammalian processes (e.g., typical transcription rate, protein half-lives in mammalian cells, etc.). If circuits become very large, stochastic effects and cell-to-cell variability might need consideration; we could integrate stochastic simulation (which Tellurium/libRoadRunner supports) or use Gillespie algorithms for key parts.

### Scalability and Cloud Resources

Mammalian designs can be large (multiple genes, each several thousand bp, with complex regulatory sequences). Simulation of large networks or running deep learning models for sequence design can be computationally intensive. While the initial version should run locally, we recommend designing the system so that heavy tasks can be offloaded to cloud or HPC resources later. For example, model training or exhaustive off-target search could be done via cloud APIs if needed. The agent could be configured to use cloud-based tools for certain steps when available (e.g., a cloud service for large-scale DNA sequence optimization) – but this will be an optional extension. Initially, caching intermediate results and using efficient local algorithms will suffice for moderate-size circuits.

### Design Considerations Unique to Mammalian Systems

In mammalian cells, genetic context and epigenetics play a big role. Unlike in *E. coli*, inserting the same DNA sequence in different genomic locations can yield different expression due to chromatin. To mitigate this, our design might prefer landing pads or known genomic safe harbors if designing cell lines, or use extrachromosomal systems (like plasmids or viral vectors) but with insulators. The agent might need to plan for such context by including insulator elements (e.g., CTCF binding sites or scaffold attachment regions). We should update the design rules and constraints for mammalian circuits to include these considerations (for instance, avoid CpG motifs in promoter if using certain cells, to prevent methylation).

### Hierarchical or Modular Design

Mammalian circuits can be broken into modules (e.g., a sensing module, a logic gate module, an actuation module). The LLM agent can scale better if it designs in a modular fashion. In the future, we can program the agent to design and test sub-circuits (modules) independently and then compose them, which is more tractable than designing 10-gene networks in one shot. This hierarchical approach aligns with how many mammalian gene circuits are built (e.g., first design individual logic gates like AND, OR using CRISPRi, then connect them). We will prepare the system to handle such multi-module designs, which the LLM can coordinate (ensuring compatibility at interfaces between modules).

### Validation and Iteration in Mammalian Context

The same agent-driven iteration will apply, but the "ground truth" checks might be more involved. For instance, instead of a binary ON/OFF, mammalian outputs might be graded (a certain level of fluorescence). The agent's analysis might require more nuanced objectives (like minimize basal expression and maximize induced expression, with some weighted score). We should incorporate the ability for the user (or agent) to define such multi-objective criteria and possibly use optimization algorithms under the hood. The LLM can manage the multi-objective trade-offs by phrasing it as "we need to improve X without hurting Y too much," but a numeric optimizer could assist. In later versions, a hybrid approach (LLM + evolutionary algorithm for fine-tuning parameter values) could be used for very complex designs.

### Knowledge Transfer and Learning

As we build the mammalian version, we will accumulate data on what works. The agent can be augmented with this knowledge. For example, if we find certain promoter-gene combinations consistently fail due to chromatin silencing, the agent's prompt or training can include: "avoid using promoter P in mammalian context." This ensures the LLM doesn't waste iterations on known pitfalls. Over time, the system becomes smarter and more tailored to mammalian design.

In conclusion, scaling to mammalian systems is feasible with careful enhancement of each component: a richer part library, more powerful sequence design models, more sophisticated simulations, and additional rules for context. The project plan is to first validate the workflow in *E. coli* (where parts are well-behaved), then gradually incorporate mammalian components in a test environment (perhaps yeast or HEK293 cell culture, as intermediate complexity). By modularizing the system, we can plug in mammalian-specific tools when ready. The LLM-driven approach is flexible – the agent's reasoning process remains the same; we primarily swap out the backend tools and data for ones suited to the new domain. With these adaptations, the system will be positioned to automate genetic circuit design in mammalian cells, accelerating the development of complex gene networks for therapeutic and biotechnological applications, much as it does for microbial systems.
